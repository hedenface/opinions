# Travel With Light Sails

We need to start sending a lot of devices into space. These devices need to fitted with:

* A light sail
* Solar power cells
* Multi-specific-directional light output
* Multi-directional location sensors
* Multi-directional transmittal devices

Each device sends transmission data so that other devices can detect them. Each device tracks all the other devices.

The closest devices to one will help power it by sending light to it (in conjuction with the current system's star).

Multiple devices can send light to a device in order to help it shift direction if required.
